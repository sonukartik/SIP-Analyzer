        <h2>No Financial Advice</h2>
        <p>

            as personalized financial advice.
        </p>

        <h2>Investment Risks</h2>
        <p>All investments carry inherent risks, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Market volatility can significantly impact investment returns</li>
            <li>Inflation may erode the purchasing power of your investments</li>
            <li>Economic conditions and policy changes can affect investment performance</li>
            <li>Currency fluctuations may impact international investments</li>
            <li>Interest rate changes can affect bond and equity markets</li>
            <li>Company-specific risks may impact individual stock investments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Calculator Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            Our calculators use mathematical models and assumptions that may not reflect real market conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Returns are projected based on historical data and assumptions</li>
            <li>Tax calculations are simplified and may not reflect your specific situation</li>
            <li>Market timing, economic cycles, and external factors are not accounted for</li>
            <li>Expense ratios and fees may vary from actual fund costs</li>
            <li>Results are approximations and should not be treated as guarantees</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consult Professionals</h2>
        <p>
            Before making any investment decisions, we strongly recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consulting with a qualified financial advisor</li>
            <li>Speaking with a tax professional about tax implications</li>
            <li>Reviewing fund prospectuses and official documents</li>
            <li>Understanding your risk tolerance and investment timeline</li>
            <li>Considering your complete financial situation</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">

            <li>Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) implications</li>
        </ul>
